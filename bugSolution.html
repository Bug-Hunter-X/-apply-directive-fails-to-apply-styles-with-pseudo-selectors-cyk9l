The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors.  Instead, apply the styles directly using standard class names:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

This approach correctly applies the `bg-blue-500` style when the button is hovered.  This removes the ambiguity and ensures proper functioning of pseudo-selector styles.
